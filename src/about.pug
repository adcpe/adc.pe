      p I'm a Web Developer who specializes in VueJS, Ruby On Rails and static web pages. I started coding back in 2018 and decided to become a developer in early 2020.
      p I have always enjoyed working with computers. It began at an early age when my dad got me a computer with Windows 3.1. For a long, long time I ran Windows but had an eye on the Linux space. Then, in 2007, I decided to order an Ubuntu CD to try it out. Since then I've been hooked on Linux. Eventually I moved on to Linux Mint. After a little while and after hopping various Linux distros I decided to try Arch Linux and I haven't looked elsewhere since.
